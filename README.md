# Nature Theme for JetBrains PHPStorm 2

Itâ€™s a very light and pleasant theme based on TextMate's Dawn theme. It supports all default languages in PhpStorm 2.1 plus CoffeeScript.

## Installation
On Mac put `phpstorm-nature-theme.xml` in ``~/Library/Preferences/WebIDE10/colors/`, restart PHPStorm and choose it in application Preferences. Locations for other systems can be found [in the official documentation](http://devnet.jetbrains.net/docs/DOC-181).
